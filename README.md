# bankSystem
A small system of bank, made with C++

I'm making this mini system to practice my programming skills and logic, all in C++, currently the language I'm learning in college and studying

The idea is to make a ''Mini'' Banking System, where you can withdraw, deposit, transfer and check your balance, you can also contact a ''Fictitious Support'', just for aesthetics
